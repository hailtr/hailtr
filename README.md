# Hi, I'm Rafael Ortiz  
**Data Engineer | Systems Builder | Automation Architect**

I build complete data systems — from ingestion, orchestration, and storage to analytics, automation, and backend services.

---

## About Me

I design and implement data workflows that replace fragile, manual operations with **engineered, scalable pipelines**.

My work blends:
- Data engineering (batch + streaming)
- Backend/API development
- Cloud automation
- Database & warehouse design
- Operational analytics
- Real-world problem solving

I like systems that *run themselves* — not dashboards glued together.

## What I'm Working On Now

### **1. Streaming Data Engineering Monorepo (Active Project)**
A full data platform foundation built from scratch:

- **Redpanda (Kafka-compatible)** for streaming  
- **PostgreSQL** for operational storage  
- **DuckDB** for analytical transformations  
- Power BI / other tools for analytics  
- Modular pipelines for multi-source ingestion  
- Infrastructure Dockerized + extensible

This monorepo is intentionally designed to expand into multiple subprojects:
- ingestion services  
- transformation pipelines  
- analytics layers  
- monitoring  
- alternative frontends (Looker, Streamlit, Power BI, GCP, etc)  

Born from the question:  
**“Why choose one stack when I can engineer all of them?”**

---

### **2. Java Selenium Scraper (Completed)**
A production-grade scraper built for a technical challenge:  
stable, optimized, and engineered for maintainability.

Extracts, structures, and stores web data efficiently.  
Expandable into:  
- asynchronous ingestion  
- automated batch processing  
- API-driven storage  

---

### **3. ‘Stealth’ App Project (WIP)**
A collaboration project exploring backend logic, architecture, and user flows.  
More details soon.
